## Mission
{: #mission .scroll-mt-32 }

Outdooractive’s product suite spans native iOS and Android apps, a rich web experience, and partner integrations that serve millions of outdoor enthusiasts. Liam was tasked with stabilising release quality while sustaining a rapid delivery cadence. He translated customer signals and operational constraints into a dependable release playbook.

## Leadership in action
{: #leadership .scroll-mt-32 }

- Coordinated fortnightly regression and exploratory testing across mobile and web, surfacing issues that consistently reduced pre-release bugs by double digits.
- Embedded a shared prioritisation rhythm with product, UX, and engineering teams so feedback loops informed roadmap conversations in near real time.
- Mentored support specialists through complex second-line investigations, building confidence to resolve technical escalations without slowing product delivery.

## Impact

Outdooractive now ships weekly with clearer visibility of product health. Customer support volume dropped as the knowledge base and triage process matured, and leadership receives concise release intelligence to direct investment.
