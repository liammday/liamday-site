## Mission
{: #mission .scroll-mt-32 }

The Combat CIS School needed to deliver more qualified specialists without expanding headcount. Liam led Project HERMES to redesign the entire training suite, aligning instructors, stakeholders, and accreditation bodies around a streamlined pathway.

## Leadership in action

- Consolidated nine legacy courses into five integrated pathways, freeing 960 instructor hours annually while preserving operational readiness.
- Facilitated Agile ceremonies and cross-functional planning to keep front-line units, training designers, and accreditation teams aligned on delivery risks and dependencies.
- Developed transparent progression frameworks for 32 subject matter experts, unlocking promotions for 12 instructors and retaining six pivotal specialists.

## Impact

The reimagined syllabus increased qualified student output by 30% and equipped instructors with time to focus on complex coaching. Project HERMES now underpins the Army’s ability to scale specialist communications talent.
