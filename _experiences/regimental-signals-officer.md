- Authored deployment playbooks and rehearsals that secured a gold standard assessment in Kenya, providing uninterrupted communications across dispersed operating bases.
- Expanded the pool of trained communications specialists from 2 per company to 8 through targeted upskilling and scenario-based drills.
- Introduced organisation-wide crypto handling training and audit routines, maintaining 100% compliance and eliminating reportable incidents.

## Impact
