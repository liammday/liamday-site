title: Coaching Rituals That Unlock Product Design Teams
description: Practical rituals to help design leaders grow autonomy, craft, and confidence across distributed teams.

Leading a product design team is as much about people as it is about product. Over the years I’ve found that predictable,
human-centred coaching rituals help designers feel supported while creating space for them to grow.

## 1. Weekly one-to-ones with shared agendas

A lightweight shared agenda keeps conversations focused on what matters most to each designer. I encourage teammates to
note wins, blockers, and topics they want feedback on in advance. My role in these sessions is to listen, ask thoughtful
questions, and identify moments where they can stretch.

## 2. Critique clubs outside project work

Critique isn’t just for project milestones. We run informal critique clubs where designers bring experiments, sketches,
or provocations that may never ship. The goal is to practice giving and receiving feedback in a low-risk space, building
trust and sharpening craft.

## 3. Reflection prompts during delivery

Project velocity can make it hard to pause. I integrate reflection prompts into sprint ceremonies—questions like “What’s
the riskiest assumption we’re making?” or “Who did we learn from this week?” They help teams stay intentional about
inclusive practices and research depth.

These rituals aren’t silver bullets, but they’ve consistently grown confidence, improved outcomes, and created healthier
design cultures wherever I’ve worked.
