## Overview

As NHS Digital prepared to scale NHS Login nationally, the team identified accessibility gaps that could block adoption by
patients with assistive technology needs. We set out to make the service compliant and welcoming for all users.

## Responsibilities

* Partnered with accessibility specialists to run audits, usability testing, and assistive tech labs.
* Led co-design sessions with visually impaired and neurodivergent participants to understand real-world contexts.
* Collaborated with engineers to implement improvements spanning interaction design, content design, and error handling.

## Outcome

* Achieved WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, enabling the national launch of NHS Login to 30M+ citizens.
* Introduced an accessibility playbook now used across NHS Digital product teams.
* Received positive feedback from patient advocacy groups and the Government Digital Service accessibility community.
