Project HERMES reimagined how the Combat CIS School prepares soldiers for dismounted close combat operations. Liam led the initiative end-to-end, translating operational constraints into a streamlined syllabus and modernised delivery model.

## Delivery highlights

- Consolidated nine legacy courses into five integrated pathways through syllabus and qualification redesign, saving 960 instructor hours each year.
- Used Agile ceremonies to align stakeholders from across the Combat CIS School and front-line units, ensuring priorities and dependencies were transparent throughout delivery.
- Built progression frameworks for 32 Subject Matter Experts, leading to 12 promotions and retaining six specialists whose expertise was critical to the programme.
- Coordinated tooling and data collection so training outcomes and readiness metrics could be monitored in real time.
