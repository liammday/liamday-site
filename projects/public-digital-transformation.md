## Context

Public Digital partners with governments and civic institutions to build the skills, teams, and capabilities needed to
work in the open and deliver better public services. The organisation needed a repeatable transformation playbook that
could align senior stakeholders while giving delivery teams confidence to experiment.

## Approach

* Led discovery interviews with directors, policy leads, and delivery teams across six departments to map shared pain
  points.
* Facilitated cross-functional workshops to define desired outcomes and the measures that would indicate progress.
* Coached internal teams on service design practices, introducing new rituals such as design critiques and show & tell
  sessions.

## Impact

* Established a measurable set of outcomes and success indicators adopted across three transformation programmes.
* Reduced onboarding time for new teams by 40% through a clarified delivery model and supporting artefacts.
* Strengthened Public Digitalâ€™s positioning in competitive bids, contributing to two multi-year contract renewals.
