## Overview
{: #overview .scroll-mt-32 }

RidgeRunner Companion is my personal test bed for the operational habits I coach in client teams. The iOS app supports solo hikers
with curated route intelligence, dynamic weather readiness cues, and after-action journalling. Each release exercises the
foundations of dependable product delivery—continuous QA, transparent changelogging, and instrumentation that closes the loop
between user signal and roadmap decisions.

## Product direction
{: #direction .scroll-mt-32 }

- **Audience focus:** Experienced hikers and mountain leaders who need fast, trustworthy guidance in the field.
- **Differentiator:** Layers route cards, weather alerts, and kit checks into a single view that stays useful offline.
- **Commercial intent:** Freemium model with premium packs for advanced mapping overlays and guided itineraries.
- **Success signals:** Activation through saved routes, weekly retention from journal entries, and support demand trending down as
  in-app education matures.

## Build focus

Current development sprints explore three core themes:

1. **Offline-first resilience** – background sync tasks keep topo tiles, safety notices, and kit lists current without requiring
   manual refreshes.
2. **Quality loops** – XCTest suites plus TestFlight feedback groups mirror the cross-functional QA rooms I facilitate in client
   organisations.
3. **Insight instrumentation** – privacy-conscious analytics quantify how features land, feeding a public changelog and backlog
   priorities.

The build journal on this page will continue to evolve as I publish release notes and architectural learnings.
