## Challenge

Thought Machineâ€™s rapid growth created inconsistencies in the Vault product experience. Teams across London, Singapore,
and New York were shipping features independently, resulting in rework and accessibility issues.

## What I did

* Built a design system squad including product designers, engineers, and technical writers.
* Defined token-based design foundations and component standards for consumer and operator experiences.
* Introduced contribution workflows, documentation patterns, and governance rituals with product and engineering leadership.

## Results

* Enabled 5 product squads to ship features 30% faster by eliminating repetitive component build time.
* Increased accessibility compliance scores from 65% to 92% through inclusive defaults and testing guidance.
* Created a culture of shared ownership with quarterly audits and roadmap planning tied to company OKRs.
